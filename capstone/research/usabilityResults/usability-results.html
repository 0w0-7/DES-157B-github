            <h2>Ignoring the Sidebar</h2>
            <p>
                The first observation that I made was how the sidebar holding the patient’s information as well as the supply and demand slider was being ignored. It was noted that it seemed as if the sidebar was an ad placement. There was no clear indication between how the sidebar and the story from the slides correlated with each other.

            <h2>Introduction/Instructions</h2>
            <p>
                The second observation I realized that the users had no idea what they were entering into. There was no explanation as to what they should expect from the content of the site. This led to ignoring the sidebar as well as a confusion as to what they should take away from the story; how the story correlates to the sidebar.

            <h2>Slider is out of place</h2>
            <p>
                The third observation made was that the interactive slider wasn’t cohesive with the rest of the interactions and content on the page. The slider felt like it’s own little interaction that’s never referred to but left there because the content never addresses it. This is made clear when there’s a correlation between the story slides and the updated patient info in the sidebar.

            <h2>Plan</h2>
            <p>
                I plan to add instructions in the beginning of the slides to point the user’s attention towards the sidebar and what they should expect from it as they scroll. This could be in the form of pop ups or just purely added text. The patient info in the sidebar would be more clearly correlated with the story and the changing text would be emphasized. I plan to achieve this by making the background more in line with the slides. This would separate the patient info and slider. The slider would be left alone but with an added pop up to explain what it is. Although this further separates it from the content, the pop up should help explain its correlation to the story.
