                The content here focuses on bringing in patients and making sure this clinic would provide them with the best care. It acts essentially like any other landing page. The intent is to make visitors feel as if they could trust this clinic and that this clinic could provide the best care. The interface consists of buttons, cards, and a search bar. The site first presents users with a way to make appointments followed by a search bar for diseases and conditions. Within the mid page the site ensures the users the clinic can be trusted utilizing cards that then explain in detail why that is. Lastly, the site lists locations where this clinic can be found. The overall experience is very professional and trustworthy.

                The intent within this site is to provide resources on nursing education and practices. The content contains data and statistics, scholarships, nursing pathways, events and programs, as well as current news on nursing. The audience here is towards students looking to get into nursing. The interface holds a tab bar at the top of the page where all the content is laid out. Though the interaction design is not that interesting, the user experience in regards to data on the nursing shortage was very informative and helpful as it provided clear graphs and showed impact.
