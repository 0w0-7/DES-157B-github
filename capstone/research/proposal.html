            My topic is on the shortage of nurses due to the aging population of nurses. As nurses reach retirement and leave the field or for other factors, this increases the amount of patients coming in. It also increases the burden and labor on current nurses. In turn, the lack of nurses compromises the quality of care that is able to be given to patients and puts a heavy physical and mental strain on them. The target audience would be students who are starting to think about their future, career, and interests. That would be high school and undergrad students.

            From the lenses we have discussed in class, my topic would most likely rely on utopian and dystopian narratives as well as data visualization.

            I plan to use scrolling as the main interaction for my project. Through scrolling I would implement images, gifs, and text that would slide onto the screen. I would make certain sections animate as you scroll down and have images and text slide horizontally on scroll as well. I would additionally add interactive buttons or interactions on press.

            The only main concern that I have for this project is how I would implement the interactive features we have gone over thus far to support the narrative of my content and data. Otherwise, if the data is not difficult to find, then I donâ€™t see any other challenges other than getting my code to work the way I intend for it to work to fit my narrative.
