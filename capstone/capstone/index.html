            <div class="content">
                <p>This project focuses on the nursing shortage and the problems it causes for both nurses and patients. Due to the baby boom, the number of people over the age of 65 has surged. Within the nursing industry, it means more nurses are reaching retirement. For the general population it means increased risk of chronic illnesses.</p>

                <p>What this project aims to do is to emphasize the problematic impact this could have on the general society and any individual if this problem isn’t addressed; that the impact of this shortage can cost lives. It focuses on presenting a dystopian narrative. The target audience are state level policy makers, educational institutions, and students.</p>

            <h2>Project Research</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>During this comparative analysis I found that healthcare sites primarily use colors of blue and white with supported content being welcoming. As these sites are made to make patients feel a sense of trust and care, the UI is emphasized to reflect that. I found that images had people smiling, all elements had rounded corners, no harsh lines, and the typography had a natural soft flow to it. All was done to make all who visit the site feel safe. With this in mind, I made the decision to reflect these characteristics in the UI but present a dystopian narrative. This was to make the audience feel a sense of tragedy that could occur in an environment of care.</p>

                <p>As I did statistical research, I found that there was more to the shortage than just the increase in people over the age of sixty-five. Many factors played a part, but the one group this shortage has a direct impact on are the patients these nurses are caring for. It's the system and the conditions that the nurses work under that fails to provide adequate care. The people this shortage affects, it was this narrative of a dystopian future that I wanted to present.</p>

                <p>The color of the UI (blue and white) was based on common colors seen within health care. These were essentially very light, soft, gentle, pastel colors ranging between white, blue, light green, light purple, and yellow. This was decided to not only help make the connection with healthcare and give context in that regard but it was also to make them feel safe.</p>

                <p>The typeface used for my project’s whole current design is Verdana. Verdana is the default typeface used within HTML and CSS. This typeface was not intended to be used but was left without change due to time constraints and my forgetfulness. On further iterations, I would choose a font closer to Times New Roman for the header, titles and subtitles. For body and all other action text, I would choose something similar to inter or roboto.</p>

                <div class="column">
                    <p>From what I observed in the comparative analysis, I found many elements to reflect the characteristics of being calm, gentle, and safe. Within my project I wanted to mimic those characteristics as well. One of the design patterns I used came in the form of rounding corners through the border radius such as images, boxes, slider, health bar, and button.</p>

                    <p>When it came to longer pieces of text that I displayed in each section of the slide, I would keep it short and spaced out for readability and reduce cognitive load. The number of words across is maximized at about ten words average and the number of sentences within each paragraph to be two sentences long.</p>

                    <p>On the right side I made the decision to show the number of slides present through carousel indicators to improve engagement. The navigation of this site is a vertical scroll. How this is indicated is through a piece of actionable text at the bottom of the first slide which users can also click to move down.</p>

                    <p>Lastly, when it came to telling the full story of this nursing shortage, I added two interactive boxes on the left side. This sidebar contains two interactive elements. One of them is of the patient of this narrative being told to indicate heart rate and current condition. As they move through the site, the heart rate decreases to reflect worsening conditions. The second is of the nurse and their working schedule to reflect their change of working condition throughout their shift.</p>

                <p>The results of the user testing done in class showed that people were ignoring the sidebar, even thinking the sidebar were ads. Within the first slide they were confused as to how to interact with the site. Lastly, the interactions with the supply and demand slider felt out of place as there was no clear or direct connection to the story that was being told. <br> <br>From those results I learned that there needed to be instructions that instructed the users before they went through the site. This was the case for both how to interact with the sidebar as well as what the interaction with the rest of the site would entail. Therefore I added pop up instructions for the sidebar and a clear note above an arrow on the left to indicate why they’re scrolling. Additionally, I realized that the supply and demand had no clear play/role within the story that was being told. It was just a plain interaction with some data. Though helped to provide information on the topic, but failed to help tell the story. From this I decided to replace that interaction with one of a nurse to show the condition of the nurse before the story begins and the user starts scrolling.</p>

                <p>With our capstone presentation I was given feedback on some improvements I could make. Moving forward I would make the BPM more visible so the user doesn’t forget about it as they scroll through the story. I would add more context to the health bar and add the number of patients being seen by the nurse for better context of the workload that nurses have. Also placing the condition of the nurse closer to the health bar for clearer connection between the two pieces of information. I would come up with a distinct color palette of a few colors to pull the design together as well as some graphics for better context regarding each slide. Lastly, I would add audio of the heart monitor that would react everytime the BPM changes. To make the story more immersive I would also include the sound of the patient flatlining as well as the car crash.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>What I learned from this project was how useful libraries are and how to work with them. I’ve also learned how beneficial user testing is especially now as I graduate not having access to peers. It allows people with a different set of eyes to view your work in areas you didn't realize needed work and to bring out ideas you wouldn’t have otherwise had.</p>

                <p>I’m most proud of the narrative that I was able to lay out and bring the users through all the way from the beginning of when a user first lands on the site all the way to the end. The feedback to support this confirmed that the story was well received and clear.</p>

                <p>The most challenging bit of this project was implementing the libraries as well as working with JavaScript to create the interactions as intended. What also challenged me was finding a way to tell the narrative of my topic through an interactive form. I struggled to brainstorm ways to convert the data and statistics into something the user can interact with but still is cohesive, contributes to the story, and fits into the story line.</p>
